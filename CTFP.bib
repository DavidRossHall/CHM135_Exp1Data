abstract = {Concentrations of O 3, NO, NO 2, NO x and oxidant (OX=O 3+NO 2) were investigated for the first time, in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Seville metropolitan area, during 2004. This area experiences frequent photochemical pollution events, mainly in the warm season. Two different environments were analyzed and compared, an urban traffic station (Torneo) and a suburban station (Aljarafe). The concentration of OX (defined as O 3+NO 2) can be described in terms of the sum of a NO x-independent 'regional' contribution (i.e. the O 3 background), and a linearly NO x-dependent 'local' contribution. Monthly dependence of regional and local OX concentration variation at Torneo and Aljarafe stations were studied along with the annual variation of the daily mean NO x and OX. Maximum levels of OX{\textgreater}190$\mu$gm -3 where NO x{\textless}70$\mu$gm -3 at Aljarafe, and OX{\textless}170$\mu$gm -3 with NO x around 80-90$\mu$gm -3 can be expected in summer months and during daylight hours. Also during summer, but at night, more elevated NO x levels are needed in order to achieve maximum OX values (OX=130-150$\mu$gm -3 with NO x≥100$\mu$gm -3 at Aljarafe, OX=110-130$\mu$gm -3 with NO x≥100$\mu$gm -3 at Torneo). This can be used as an approximation to estimate the OX concentrations in Seville for each month, as a function of the NO x measured, as well as to improve in the atmospheric photochemical dynamic in the Spanish Western Mediterranean area where there are undeniable air quality problems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {As one approach to moving beyond transmitting "inert" ideas to chemistry students, we use the term "teaching from rich contexts" to describe implementations of case studies or context-based learning based on systems thinking that provide deep and rich opportunities for learning crosscutting concepts through contexts. This approach nurtures the use of higher-order cognitive skills to connect concepts and apply the knowledge gained to new contexts. We describe the approach used to design a set of resources that model how rich contexts can be used to facilitate learning of general chemistry topics. The Visualizing the Chemistry of Climate Change (VC3) initiative provides an exemplar for introducing students in general chemistry courses to a set of core chemistry concepts, while infusing rich contexts drawn from sustainability science literacy. Climate change, one of the defining sustainability challenges of our century, with deep and broad connections to chemistry curriculum and crosscutting concepts, was selected as a rich context to introduce four topics (isotopes, acids-bases, gases, and thermochemistry) into undergraduate general chemistry courses. The creation and assessment of VC3 resources for general chemistry was implemented in seven steps: (i) mapping the correlation between climate literacy principles and core first-year university chemistry content, (ii) documenting underlying science conceptions, (iii) developing an inventory of chemistry concepts related to climate change and validating instruments that make use of the inventory to assess understanding, (iv) articulating learning outcomes for each topic, (v) developing and testing peer-reviewed interactive digital learning objects related to climate literacy principles with particular relevance to undergraduate chemistry, (vi) piloting the materials with first-year students and measuring the change in student understanding of both chemistry and climate science concepts, and (vii) disseminating the interactive resources for use by chemistry educators and students. A novel feature of the approach was to design resources (step v) based on tripartite sets of learning outcomes (step iv) for each chemistry and climate concept, with each knowledge outcome accompanied by an outcome describing the evidential basis for that knowledge, and a third outcome highlighting the relevance of that knowledge for students.},

@article{Pour-Biazar2007,
abstract = {Clouds can significantly affect photochemical activities in the boundary layer by altering radiation intensity, and therefore their correct specification in the air quality models is of outmost importance. In this study we introduce a technique for using the satellite observed clouds to correct photolysis rates in photochemical models. This technique was implemented in EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) and was tested over a 10 day period in August 2000 that coincided with the Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS). The simulations were performed at 4 and 12 km grid size domains over Texas, extending east to Mississippi, for the period of 24 to 31 August 2000. The results clearly indicate that inaccurate cloud prediction in the model can significantly alter the predicted atmospheric chemical composition within the boundary layer and exaggerate or underpredict ozone concentration. Cloud impact is acute and more pronounced over the emission source regions and can lead to large errors in the model predictions of ozone and its by-products. At some locations the errors in ozone concentration reached as high as 60 ppb which was mostly corrected by the use of our technique. Clouds also increased the lifetime of ozone precursors leading to their transport out of the source regions and causing further ozone production down-wind. Longer lifetime for nitrogen oxides (NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} = NO + NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) and its transport over regions high in biogenic hydrocarbon emissions (in the eastern part of the domain) led to increased ozone production that was missing in the control simulation. Over Houston-Galveston Bay area, the presence of clouds altered the chemical composition of the atmosphere and reduced the net surface removal of reactive nitrogen compounds. Use of satellite observed clouds significantly improved model predictions in areas impacted by clouds. Errors arising from an inconsistency in the cloud fields can impact the performance of photochemical models used for case studies as well as for air quality forecasting. Air quality forecast models often use the model results from the previous forecast (or some adjusted form of it) for the initialization of the new forecast. Therefore such errors can propagate into the future forecasts, and the use of observed clouds in the preparation of initial concentrations for air quality forecasting could be beneficial.

Students can choose from several preprogrammed mechanisms and initial conditions for important environmental-chemistry problems, and only clicking a few buttons is needed to perform a simulation and obtain graphs with concentrations and chemical fluxes. The mechanism and initial conditions can be edited very easily to study other cases. Feedback from its use in courses shows the effectiveness of KinSim in helping students conduct computer experiments to gain familiarity with environmental chemical systems and helping them gain deeper understanding of the complex emergent behaviors of the systems.

The psychomotor domain is the essence of the chemistry laboratory, but the extent to which the cognitive and affective domains are integrated into the laboratory is unknown. For meaningful learning to occur in the undergraduate chemistry laboratory, students must actively integrate both the cognitive domain and the affective domains into the "doing" of their laboratory work. The Meaningful Learning in the Laboratory Instrument (MLLI) was designed to measure students' expectations before and after laboratory courses and experiences, in both the cognitive and affective domains, within the context of conducting experiments in the undergraduate chemistry laboratory. The MLLI was pilot-tested and modified based on an analysis of the pilot study data. The revised, 31-item MLLI was administered online both at the beginning and end of a semester to both general and organic chemistry laboratory students. Evidence for both the validity and reliability of the data, as well as comparisons between general and organic chemistry students' responses, are discussed.},

Because of the large number of courses required for the undergraduate chemistry major, it seems unlikely that requiring a course on statistics will be practical at most institutions. Additionally, it is unlikely that the typical high school education will address the needed statistics or the software training to prepare students for the chemistry courses. Therefore, the chemistry faculty must teach the statistics needed by the majors. The faculty needs to focus on statistics useful to the chemist and this is distinctly different than what is often encountered in biology, medicine, psychology, and business. A starting point is suggested for a discussion on a statistics curriculum that addresses the needs of the chemistry majors. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},
