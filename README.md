# CHM135 Experiment 1: *The Chemistry of Air Quality* Source Code
by: David Hall, davidross.hall@mail.utoronto.ca

Due to Covid-19, the tradional laboratory component of the first year CHM 135 course had to shift to virtual experiments. Experiment 1 utilises real houlr measurements of atmospheric pollutants to teach students the basics of data analysis, plotting and Microsoft Excel while they explore concepts related to atmospheric pollution. 

This repo contains:
- the R code used to generate:
  - subsets of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) hourly O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub> measurements from any National Atmospheric Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) station
  - an answer key of each ECCC NAPS data subset
- Example hourly ECCC data from 2018
- Example datasets & answer keys for three Toronto NAPS stations
